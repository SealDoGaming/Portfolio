#### Description
This was the result of me remaking a little game I made when I first learned how to code. This was my first real big project I worked on and has many big features such as...
- Animation
- Dialog
- Options Sliders
- A Level Editor with GUI

Unfornuately I never finished making it as I did not know how to go forward with it creatively. Making story, characters, enemies, and other key game components would have been exausting for me to develope. The game also being turn-based did not help either.
I may remake it again in the future with these things in mind.
